# My-first-project
A Practical Python Capstone Project whereby a Bank Account Management system is being developed for a new bank. This financial institution is aiming to provide its customers with a secure and efficient way to manage their money. As part of theirinitial service offerings, they require a basic system to handle core banking operations: creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, checking balances, and viewing transaction history. 
This Bank's initial operations will rely on a simple, command-line interface (CLI) system to manage customer accounts. They need a robust and user-friendly application. The current manual methods are inefficient and prone to errors. An automated system will streamline these processes, improve accuracy, and provide a foundation for future expansion of their service.
The aim is to  propose  the development of a Python-based application to manage their bank accounts. This system will store account information in memory during runtime and provide a menu-driven interface for performing the required operations. The system will utilize Python data structures (dictionaries and lists) and fundamental programming concepts (functions, loops, conditional statements) to manage account data and transaction history
